         <p  class="description ">
            Ask just about anyone what the difference between plant-based and
          vegan food is, and you'll get the same answer: "They're the same thing, right?"
        Contrary to what grocery store packaging and social media might insinuate, there's actually quite
          a big difference between these dietary lifestyles‚Äîand you'll probably find that you prefer one over the other,
         depending on your goals and values So what, exactly, makes a plant-based diet 
         different from a vegan diet? To get it straight, we spoke to dietitians below. 
         (Spoiler: You'll eat a lot of veggies either way.)

        <h1>VEGETABLES</h1>
        <img src="../images/leavyvegetables.jpg" alt="" width="300px" height="300pxwi">
        <p class="description">Right from the ancient days, leafy greens have been an important 
            portion of the daily diet. Being power-packed with a variety of vitamins and minerals
             makes them a mandatory addition to every healthy diet plan. The fat and sugar content of
              green leafy vegetables is minimal, which also makes them fit for a weight loss diet.
              One of the biggest benefits of consuming leafy green vegetables is that they are extremely 
              low in calories when compared to other foods. Despite being low in calories they are often
               dense in nutrients, which is why they are a preferred food item in a weight loss diet.</p>

        <P class="description">Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter,

              other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.

        <P class="description">The majority of a raw food diet will usually be 
            plant-based, although with a lower grain content 
            than a typical vegan diet. Some people consume unpasteurised
            dairy products, and others also include raw (and, sometimes, dehydrated/dried)
             meat and fish.Chapman Family Cancer Wellness at Piedmont,
              says incorporating raw foods, specifically vegetables and fruits,
               into your diet can have numerous health benefits.
