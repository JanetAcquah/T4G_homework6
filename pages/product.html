<p>Canned foods are minimally processed. Fruits and vegetables destined for 
    cans are picked at peak ripeness and packed quickly after being harvested.
     After being cleaned and prepared, they are sealed in 
    steel cans and then quickly 'cooked in the can' to
    lock in nutrients and preserve taste and quality.
    Canned foods can be just as nutritious as fresh and frozen foods because canning preserves many nutrients. 
    The amount of minerals, fat-soluble vitamins, protein, fat and carbohydrate remain 
    relatively unchanged by the process of canning.</p>
